# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website. This site is a showcase of my projects, skills, and experiences as a developer. It serves not only as a platform to display my work but also as a refresher on the foundational web technologies: pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About the Project

This portfolio website is built from the ground up using only pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without relying on any frameworks or libraries. The decision to not use any frameworks or libraries was intentional so as to serve as a refresher on the basics of web development.

### Features

- **Responsive Design:** Crafted to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.
- **Portfolio Showcase:** A dedicated section to display projects with descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos or GitHub repositories.
- **Contact Form:** A simple, yet functional contact form implemented with HTML and JavaScript, showcasing form handling and validation techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The backbone of the site, used to structure content.
- **CSS:** For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity to the site, from simple animations to content manipulation.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio website. Feel free to explore the projects and get in touch through the contact form if you have any questions or opportunities to discuss.
